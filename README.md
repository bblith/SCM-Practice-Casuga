## What is SCM? How GitHub Helps
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is the process of systematically organizing and controlling changes to software. It ensures consistency and traceability throughout the development lifecycle. GitHub supports SCM by enabling version control, collaborative development, and easy branching/merging. It keeps track of changes, facilitates teamwork, and helps prevent configuration drift and code conflicts.
